# Personal Library

A simple Web application to record my personal book collection.

Currently only the server component (perlib-server) is available,
and there is a plan to develop a web client component (perlib-client).

perlib-server (Spring Boot) exposes required CRUD API methods and stores data into a DB (H2).
Other relevant information is available within the component's README file.
